#A suggested way to work on your code in Cloud9
#is to have a terminal  window open and an editor window with this
#file loaded.  Make changes to this file, save them, and then
#run 'ruby part1.rb' at the command line, this will run your program with
#the specified test cases.  You may want to add additional test cases to
#make sure that you have thoroughly tested your code.
#Alternatively, if you are confident with rspec syntax, you can add additional
#tests to the spec/part1_spec.rb file to thoroughly test your
#program and test it by typing:
#'rspec spec/part1_spec.rb'
#You will need to be in the parent directory of the spec directory when
#you type this command.
# NOTE:  THE PROVIDED RSPEC TESTS ARE ONLY MINIMAL SANITY CHECKS TO INSURE
#THAT OUR AUTOMATED GRADER WILL BE ABLE TO GRADE YOUR SUBMISSION.  THEY DO
#NOT COMPREHENSIVELY TEST THE CORRECTNESS OF YOUR SOLUTION.
#Be absolutely certain that your code passess the rspec sanity checks before
#submitting it.  If it doesn't pass these sanity checks, our autrograder will
#not be able to grade it.
#
#It is up to you to add sufficient test cases to this file (or additonal rspec tests to
#the spec/part1_spec.rb file) to thoroughly test your program.
#
#When you are satisfied with your work, REMOVE THE TEST CASES and save your file.
#When you have completed all five parts of the assignment, follow the submission
#instructions specified in the assignment description to hand-in your work.
